=========

The profiles in this repository are for [Unison](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/), the awesome file synchronisation tool.

> Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.

If you want to learn more about it, the [documentation](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download/releases/stable/unison-manual.html) gets you started.
